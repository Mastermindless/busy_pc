## busy_pc

If you need the pc to look busy, but it must not show any relevant information

## How it works:

	1.	Progress Bar: Displays a progress bar, cycling between 0% and 100%, in cyan for variety.
	2.	Matrix Effect: The falling green letters continue to simulate the Matrix movie.
	3.	ASCII Art: Randomly displays ASCII art images at intervals of 2 seconds. You can add more images to the ascii_images array.
	4.	Color Mixing: Uses multiple colors (green, cyan, yellow, red, blue) for a vibrant look.

## To Run:

	1.	Save the script as simulate_busy_pc_colorful.sh.
	2.	Make it executable with chmod +x simulate_busy_pc_colorful.sh.
	3.	Run it with ./simulate_busy_pc_colorful.sh.
